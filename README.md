# Causal-Analysis-HR-Attrition

HR Analytics: Employee Attrition

Why Is This Problem Important to me? 
I saw a job posting in HR data and was asked what types of problems they were trying to solve with data.
I found exact this problem that called "employee arritation." 
The business problem. Why do they want to analyze it? How can it be usefull for them and for their employees? 
It allows to find some insights about why we have this rate of attrition. 
Insights that will be usefull for Recritment and Managers department how they can reduce the % of arritation. 
Because it reduce the cost of new hirings. And to strive for employee satisfaction. 

2 Goals: 
- identify factors associated with attrition (EDA) 
- identify which changes will actually reduce employee attraction while providing manageable business solutions. (Causal Inference)

Final conlusions:
“Conducted causal analysis (PSM) on HR data to estimate causal effects of key factors on employee attrition,
enabling manageable business decisions that can reduce attrition rate by ~22%.”
